Project Summary
________________________________________________________

In this project, we extended the code we wrote in Project 1 to include
LinHashMap.java and BpTreeMap.java. These two data structures helped 
increase the efficiency of Table.java, where tuples from MovieDB.java
are manipulated in different ways and outputted to the console. 
This project also includes integration tests that test Table.java as
well as the new classes that we implemented. 
This project has a build.sbt file in order for the project to be 
compatible for compiling and running with sbt.
